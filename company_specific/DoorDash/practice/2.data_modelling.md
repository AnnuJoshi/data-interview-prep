### Data Modeling Case Study Prep 

Overview: This scenario-based interview will focus on
your product sense and data modeling skills. You’ll be
assessed on\
data literacy,\
data warehousing,\
ETL implementation,\
collaboration skills, and your product sense. 

You will be asked to **design some metrics** and
create an **entity-relationship diagram**, and will create an
ETL flow using the data model you designed. You will be
evaluated not only on the strength of your solution, but
also your approach and level of autonomy in working
through the problem. You will be collaborating with the
interviewer through a Google Doc. You will be asked to
write SQL, but the code does not need to have perfect syntax.

What we’re looking for:\
● Problem Solving: We want to get a sense of how you think through ambiguous problems!
We’re not necessarily looking for the perfect, most efficient solution immediately, but want
to see how you iterate to get there.\
● Communication: Can you explain your thought process and how you arrived at a
solution? Can you receive feedback throughout the interview and course correct? We are
looking for effective communication throughout the duration of the interview, especially if
your solution isn’t working the way you intended it to.

Tips:\
● Interactive Interview: Be prepared for a highly interactive session. Asking clarifying
questions and seeking a comprehensive understanding of the problem is crucial.\
● Articulate Thought Process: If faced with difficulties, explain your solution approach and
reasoning. This transparency enables interviewers to provide valuable hints and insights.\
● Focus on the Question: The interview is designed to guide you step by step towards the
final solution. Please do not jump ahead to solutioning in the earlier sections of the
interview, where we would still be discussing the scenario.\
● Scalability: We encourage you to think about how your solution would scale with
increasing data volume and complexity.


### Resources

</summary>

- Identifying business requirements and technical constraints
- Designing a dimensional model for a data warehouse with appropriate fact and dimension tables.
- Design trade-offs: How you weigh different design options and articulate their pros and cons.
- Performance considerations: Your understanding of how to optimize the model for query performance and scalability.
- Creating an ER diagram of your solution, typically including 3-5 tables
- Adapting your data model to new requirements or feedback.


Key areas of assessment include:

1. Defining appropriate grain for fact tables
2. Identifying relevant dimensions and facts
3. Handling slowly changing dimensions
4. Considering query patterns and performance implications
5. Addressing data volume and scalability concerns
6. Articulating design choices and trade-offs

### Preparation 
<details>
<summary> Different modeling approaches</summary>
Understand trade-offs: Study the pros and cons of different modeling approaches, such as star schemas vs. snowflake schemas, or normalized vs. denormalized designs.

</details>


<details>
<summary> Dimensional Modeling</summary>
Ensure a thorough understanding of dimensional modeling, including fact tables, dimension tables, and slowly changing dimensions


### Fact data Model 
- Transaction
- Periodic Snapshot Fact Table 
- Accumulating Snapshot
- Bridge Tables (Factless Fact Tables)

### Experience

<summary> Online  </summary>

1. Fixed question - wearable device track, query writing, user avg, how many days login, logout date, BI idea, how will keys interact? (Manish Kumar Youtube)
2. You're a PM at a food delivery app where conversion rates have declined over the past week. How would you investigate the causes? (Conversion: From users browsing to placing orders.)
3. [On DoorDash, there are missing item and wrong item issues for deliveries. How would you analyze each of them?](https://www.tryexponent.com/questions/4862/doordash-order-issue-analysis)
4. Growth, scaling challenges for setting up a new DoorDash campaign (Glassdoor)
5.

### Examples 
<details>
<summary> 1. Real Time Walmart System Design </summary>

Initially business explained by interviewer - (They said transactional but expectation was analytical)

```
1. Asked for DAU = 20 million 
2. 86400 sec in a day - rounded to 10^5  (we know this)
3. 20* 10^6 / 10^5 = 200 users per sec 
4. they are writing 5 things so 200*5 = 1000 writes/sec in DB
5. Request will be 2.5 times of this = 2500 

Transactional System 
- Latency
- Consistency

Q- He asked, Why are you doing all this?
A- To asses how large the data will be, which DB should be used, latency, schema evolve, sql or no sql should be used? 
He asked for tables - wanted to go for analytical system - dimensional modelling 

Q- I asked, Which portion you want to make ? Order 
A- I said, okay Order and user 

Order Table 
- user_id (FK)
- order_id (PK)
- order_date
- order_amount
- quantity
- discount

User Table 
- user_id (PK)
- login_date 
- logout_date

Q: He asked Where are Shipment details, cart, whishlist, inventory? 
Q: Asked One to many or many to many mapping

Shipping Table (Acummulating Snapshot) - to analyse where clogging is happening in supply chain 
                                       - All dates as we know multiple steps in a shipping process
- order_id
- order_date 
- dispatch_date
- shipment_date 
- out_for_delivery_date 
- delivered_date

Cart Table 
- user_id
- product_id
- cart_added_date

Product Table 
- product_id (PK)
- seller_id

Seller Profile Table 
- seller_id
- seller


Q: If we have to search in NoSQL, user will search a query in amazon search bar, how will you do? 
A: Elastic Search - text search easier in it 
Product name - if user make a typo, we have to show all relevant products 
Let's say user type datawarehouse then we have to show him all books containing that keyword 

Q: How will you implement this? Write query for this
A: 

Q: How will user journey happen for this search and how will you return to user? He wanted to test microservices 
A: User_login -> authentication -> success -> search button /api/v1/search/ -> payload(keyword) -> will keep pools and choose one to make elastic connection -> pass payload to query -> response of the page url -> parse on the user page (encoding json, protobuff, Atlassian recently changed)

LLD 
Q: Write code to implement this 
app.post("/api/v1/search")
 Search.search()

Tried to use Design Pattern in this 

ABC is abstract base class in python 
whosoever inherit this class will have to implement these functions 

class abs_methos(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self.abc = None

    def search():
        pass

    def response():
        pass

class search(abs_method):
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = config 
    
    def search("text_serach"):
        # make connection
        
        return result
