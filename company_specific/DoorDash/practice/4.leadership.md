    <summary>  Questions  </summary>
    
1. Who is your role model
2. Conflict of slow work of a team member 
3. Big failure or challenging work - which you did and did not know earlier?
4. Values of doordash?
5. Tell me about a recent project you're proud of
6. Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone and how you resolved it?
    - In software industry, the most common disagreements happen over technical approaches, resource allocation, deadlines and estimations. These require decisions which are not always ideal or with predictable outcome.
    - Any decision involves Time, Quality and Funding. Most of the time we end up compromising one of these to gain the other two. For example, if you want the best quality, with a constrained budget, you have to spend lot of time. If you want in short time, with less funding, then quality will suffer. If you want the best quality in short time, then you have to spend a lot to hire the best team with best equipment.
7.  Tell me about a time you made a mistake
    - **Situation:** In a previous role, I led a **finance transformation initiative** aimed at automating revenue recognition and streamlining compliance with 
    - **ASC606**. The goal was to enhance efficiency and reduce manual intervention.
    - **Obstacle:** I was confident in the benefits of automation and pushed aggressively for immediate implementation. However, I underestimated the **resistance from key stakeholders*, particularly those in operations and IT, who were concerned about system disruptions and integration challenges.
    - **Action:** When I realized that my approach was causing friction, I **pivoted to a more collaborative strategy*:
    Engaged stakeholders in **workshops** to gather concerns and adjust the implementation timeline.
    Worked closely with IT to ensure a **phased rollout**, minimizing disruptions.
    Developed **change management frameworks** to improve adoption rates.
    - **Result:** While the initial rollout was delayed, the revised approach **secured stakeholder buy-in*, improved adoption rates, and ultimately led to a *30% reduction in manual intervention*. More importantly, I learned the value of *balancing urgency with stakeholder alignment**.
    - **Lesson Learned:** Since then, I’ve refined my approach to **change management*, ensuring that financial transformation projects are executed with *strategic influence rather than force*.
