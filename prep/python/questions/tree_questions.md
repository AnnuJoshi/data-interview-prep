##  Binary Tree Problems (DFS)

<details> 
  <summary>1. Maximum Path Sum</summary>
  Find the path with the highest sum of node values, starting/ending at any node; solved recursively in O(n) time, handling negative values.
  ```python 


    ```

<details> <summary> 2.Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)</summary>
Identify the deepest node with two target nodes as descendants; solved in O(n) by checking subtrees recursively
